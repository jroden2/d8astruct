# d8astruct
A public repository of Datastructure implementations in Golang 

## Whats here?
There is an initial commit with a stack, but eventually I hope to build out functionality for binary tree, hashtable and 'standard' datastructures that are usually accepted in other languages

### Complete
- [x] Trie
- [x] Stack

### In Progress?
- [ ] Linked List

### To do?
- [ ] Hashmap
- [ ] Binary Tree
